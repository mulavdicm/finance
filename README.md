### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a personal project of mine that I decided to make. A few months ago I started using an app to track my expenses. The app went broken and I lost the ability to see my transaction, but I could create a backup of the transactions in an sheet file. After then I had this file for a few weeks thinking what I should do. I decided to make my own web application to track my expenses and I could use these transactions as a sort of mold on how to form my project.
